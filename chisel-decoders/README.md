### Overview

This crate contains a very simple, lean implementations of decoders that will consume `u8` bytes from a given
`Read` implementation, and decode into the Rust internal `char` type using either UTF-8 or ASCII.

The decoder implementations are pretty fast and loose: under the covers they utilise some bit-twiddlin' in
conjunction with the *unsafe* `transmute` function to do the conversions.

*No string allocations are used during conversion*.

#### Usage

Usage is very simple, provided you have something that implements `Read` in order to source some bytes:

#### Create from a slice

Just wrap your array in a `mut` reader, and then plug it into a new instance of either `Utf8Decoder`:

```rust
    # use std::io::BufReader;
    # use chisel_decoders::utf8::Utf8Decoder;

    let buffer: &[u8] = &[0x10, 0x12, 0x23, 0x12];
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(buffer);
    let _decoder = Utf8Decoder::new(&mut reader);
```
If you're fairly certain that you're dealing with ASCII only, then just pick the `AsciiDecoder` instead:

```rust
    # use std::io::BufReader;
    # use chisel_decoders::ascii::AsciiDecoder;

    let buffer: &[u8] = &[0x10, 0x12, 0x23, 0x12];
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(buffer);
    let _decoder = AsciiDecoder::new(&mut reader);
```

#### Create from a file

Just crack open your file, wrap in a `Read` instance and then plug into a new instance of `Utf8Decoder`:

```rust
    # use std::fs::File;
    # use std::io::BufReader;
    # use std::path::PathBuf;
    # use chisel_decoders::utf8::Utf8Decoder;

    let path = PathBuf::from("./Cargo.toml");
    let f = File::open(path);
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(f.unwrap());
    let _decoder = Utf8Decoder::new(&mut reader);
```
#### Consuming Decoded `chars`

Once you've created an instance of a specific decoder, you simply iterate over the `chars` in
order to pull out the decoded characters (a decoder implements `Iterator<Item=char>`):

```rust
    # use std::fs::File;
    # use std::io::BufReader;
    # use std::path::PathBuf;
    # use chisel_decoders::utf8::Utf8Decoder;

    let path = PathBuf::from("./Cargo.toml");
    let f = File::open(path);
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(f.unwrap());
    let decoder = Utf8Decoder::new(&mut reader);
    for c in decoder {
       println!("char: {}", c)
    }
```


## Building and Testing
